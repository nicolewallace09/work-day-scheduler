## Installation 
This does not require installation. 

## Usage 
This application allows users to choose a time slot to enter a task. These tasks are stored in local storage so they are still accessible even when the application is refreshed. Current date is displayed on the top of the application and the times are color coded to let the user know when an event has passed, current, or in the future.<br>
